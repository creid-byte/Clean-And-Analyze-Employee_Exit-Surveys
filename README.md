# Why are people leaving our company and who are they?
Had to conduct an analysis on workplace satisfaction levels and factors that contribute to employee resignations. I highlight potential causes based on the data results, and group the supporting data types to help my company better understand their work environment.

While working through this data, we will be asking two questions:
1. Are employees who worked at the institutes for a short period leaving due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
    * What about employees who have been there longer?
2. Are younger employees leaving because of some dissatisfaction?
    * What about older employees?
