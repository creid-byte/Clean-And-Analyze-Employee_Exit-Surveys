# Clean-And-Analyze-Employee_Exit-Surveys
I represent my stakeholders, and I wish to establish why my stakeholders are leaving. We will ask 2 questions for this analysis:

1. Are employees who worked at the institutes for a short period leaving due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
    * What about employees who have been there longer?
2. Are younger employees leaving because of some dissatisfaction?
    * What about older employees?
