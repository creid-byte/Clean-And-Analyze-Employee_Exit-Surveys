# Why are people leaving our company and who are they?
I represent my stakeholders and they have given me the responsibility to understand why employees are leaving their organizations and who do they represent?

While working through this data, we will be asking two questions:
1. Are employees who worked at the institutes for a short period leaving due to some kind of dissatisfaction?
    * What about employees who have been there longer?
2. Are younger employees leaving because of some dissatisfaction?
    * What about older employees?
